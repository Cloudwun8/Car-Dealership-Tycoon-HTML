A simple HTML Car Dealership game!
Gameplay is easy to get the hang of, as it consists of buying cars, repairing them, and reselling!
Main features are Dealership system, Auctions (Both player and AI), Player garage, Car condition, loans, and save codes!


cdtpv1 is a simpler version with most bugs worked out


cdtpv2 has more features but is not complete yet, so playing is a bit rougher


cdtv6 is VERY buggy. The main causes are logic errors, or at least I hope so because those are easier to fix lol

cdtv1v2 is even worse than cdtv6, multiple logic errors
